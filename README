AFAIK the xfinity keyspace is: 5 char word + 4 char number + 6 char word
ex: fever4759harbor

xfinity-wordspace.py - quick and shitty code to generate a wordlist for the xfinity wifi keyspace

wordlists folder - contains common 6 letter and 5 letter words as well as all 4 character numbers

full-lists.tar.gz - ridiculous large 5 and 6 character word lists (not a part of keyspace.txt)

keyspace.tar.gz - full keyspace wordlist for cracking with.
